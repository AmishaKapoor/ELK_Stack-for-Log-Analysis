ELK Stack for Log Analysis and Monitoring
Elastic stack, also known as ELK stack, is a powerful collection of three open-source tools - Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana which together provide a comprehensive solution for log analysis and monitoring. It can be used to process, analyze, and visualize log data efficiently. 
One more component is needed for Data collection called Beats. Filebeat, the most used Beats module is a lightweight plugin used to collect and ship log files to Logstash. 
ELK Stack is widely used as it can meet the needs of log management and analysis. It provides users with a powerful platform that collects and processes data from multiple sources, stores that data in one centralized data store which has the capacity to scale as data grows, and provides a set of tools to analyze the data. With the help of the ELK log management tool, one can search, analyze, and visualize vast volumes of log data in real time from anywhere in the infrastructure.
